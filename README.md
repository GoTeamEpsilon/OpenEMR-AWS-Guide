# OpenEMR AWS Guide

A turnkey solution for small facilities and hospitals to run their OpenEMR v5 installation in the AWS cloud.

Many OpenEMR users run the system on premise and have not yet realized the benefits of cloud technologies. This step-by-step guide provides a straightforward approach in getting OpenEMR deployed to the cloud in a secure and reliable way.

This entire process should take about an hour. Be sure to follow the steps exactly and if any instruction confuses you, [enter a bug](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/OpenEMR-AWS-Guide/issues) so our team can improve the wording.
