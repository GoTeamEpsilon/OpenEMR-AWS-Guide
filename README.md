# OpenEMR AWS Guide

A production grade solution for small facilities and hospitals to run their OpenEMR v5 installation in the AWS cloud.

Many OpenEMR users run their system on premise and have not yet realized the benefits of cloud technologies. This step-by-step guide provides a straightforward approach in getting OpenEMR deployed to the cloud in a secure, reliable, and cloud first way.

This entire process should take about 1 to 2 hours. Be sure to follow the steps exactly and if any instruction confuses you, [enter a bug](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/OpenEMR-AWS-Guide/issues) so our open source team can improve the wording and provide you with support.

_NOTE: A [follow-along YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foobar) is provided for non-technical users that can benefit from beginner-friendly, enhanced instructions._

## üéõ Administration

#### How do I deploy custom changes to my cloud?

The most robust and maintainable approach for deployments is to keep an internal changelog of your changes along with associated [version control tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). Not only will this help you stay organized, but you can also reference it in the case you wish to rollback to a previous deployment and aid in reapplying your custom changes when a newer version of OpenEMR is available.

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and then choose **openemr/openemr**.
2. Click the **Upload and Deploy** button in the center of the screen.
3. Click **Choose File** and select "**openemr.zip**". Note that the name of this file must be exact.

5. Click **Deploy**.

#### How do I access system logs?

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and then choose **openemr/openemr**.

6. Enter the date and time for your restore under **Use Custom Restore Time**.
7. Configure the database restore instance as you did when [creating the initial system](#-database-system).
8. SSH into any EC2 instance associated with the Elastic Beanstalk environment and note the values in **openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php**.
9. Update your local **openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php** with these noted values, but with the new MySQL restore endpoint information.
10. Reploy the application via [the instructions in the deployment section](#how-do-i-deploy-custom-changes-to-my-cloud).

#### How do I Access the Database?

_TODO: Shouldn't this be using the pem file for added security?_
