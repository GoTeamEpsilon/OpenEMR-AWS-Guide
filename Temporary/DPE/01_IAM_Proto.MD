- sign up for AWS
- download google authenticator…a virtual MFA device
- set up MFA 
- Delete the Root access keys
- strict password policy with rotation, prevent reuse, special symbols, etc
- create IAM user with administratoraccess…use this account instead
- any other users??

* These are the only reasons you ever need to use the Root account: [link](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)
