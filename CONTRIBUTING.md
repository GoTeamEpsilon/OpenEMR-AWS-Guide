### Contributing

## Current Plan / Random Thoughts:
- I think most Open Source projects have this right? I think this will be useful later for recruiting too.
- Also I remember being really frustrated when starting out in programming that there were literally no projects a beginner could contribute to. Really slowed me dcown learning wise.
- Later on I'm thinking about breaking up some of the AWS tasks I'll need help with into tasks that are great for beginners, and then using labels so people can easily find them on Github. Kent C. Dodds is this guy who popularized a lot of labels like "first-timers-only", "beginners wanted", "help wanted", etc.
- Maybe reach out to bootcamps too, that way people will have a little more experience. Would be good for us because they would be more experienced, and also they would benefit a lot. They could say they worked on a project with enormous social value alongside a developer from Oracle and one of the board members from OpenEMR.
- Hacktoberfest / Summer of Code?

## Places to Get Help:
- There are a ton of meetup groups in Austin for beginners. This is a very "teach-yourself-to-code" city. Just by posting once I'd probably be flooded by requests and have to start cruelly rejecting people. So meetup.com and also facebook.com as I've seen some good groups on there
- Reddit...
- Contacting bootcamps
- Reach out to people / teams at work I have a good relationship with 
- Find well respected OpenSource healthcare people and ask them for their ideas?

## Final Solution?:
- Get Help For Project
- Help Beginners Who Are Learning To Code
- Timeline: start this within 12 weeks as project/group develops more
