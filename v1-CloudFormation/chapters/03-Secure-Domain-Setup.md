_If your domain isn't registered through Amazon, you can still host it with Route 53 by changing your domain's "NS" entries at your registrar to the NS records showing on your domain here at Amazon. That will tell the world that Amazon is the one responsible for the content of the zone file, and will let the changes you're about to make be publically visible. Alternately, you can leave your domain hosted off-Amazon entirely, but the automated SES-to-Route-53 setup in a few sections won't be available, and you'll have to modify records manually._
