### OpenEMR setup

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **CloudFormation** and review the list of stacks. One will have the name you assigned &mdash; click that stack, and the content in the tabs on the bottom half of the screen will populate. Once the status of your stack is a green **CREATE_COMPLETE**, the stack is built and you are ready to proceed.
2. Click the **Outputs** now. These are the URLs and endpoints of the various services the OpenEMR process has created for you. Make note of the contents of the RDS field, and then click the link on the **OpenEMR** line to continue the setup process.
3. Go through each step of the signup wizard using the MySQL credentials noted in previous steps. The MySQL host will be the **RDS** entry from the stack outputs tab you observed in the last step, and the database password will be what you originally gave the stack in Chapter 1. Make sure to enter a [strong password](https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=16&format=html&rnd=new) for the initial user and record it in a safe place. Note that the first step of the wizard will take a few minutes. Although the page will be white and not have any loading indicators, please do not attempt to refresh the page or resubmit the request.
4. Once the setup process completes, log in to OpenEMR with your administrative credentials.
5. Select **Administration**, then **Globals**, then **Documents**. From the dropdown, select **CouchDB**, then make the following changes:
 * For **CouchDB HostName**, enter the value of the **CouchDB** entry from the **Outputs** tab in step 2.
 * For **CouchDB Database**, enter "couchdb".
 * Check the box marked **CouchDB Log Enable**.
6. Save.
