# ðŸš´ Getting Started

### Start by getting a local copy of OpenEMR v5

1. Download the latest [tarball](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openemr/files/OpenEMR%20Current/5.0.0/openemr-5.0.0.tar.gz/download) to your computer.
2. Extract the contents with your favorite archive extractor. Note that a `tar` file will need to be extracted after the initial extraction if you are using Windows.
3. Rename the downloaded "**openemr-5.0.0**" directory to "**openemr**".
4. Enter into the "**openemr**" directory.
5. Create an AWS-specific directory called "**.ebextensions**".
6. Download [this](https://github.com/GoTeamEpsilon/OpenEMR-Cloud/raw/master/v1-Beta-AWS-Guide/assets/eb/eb.zip) zip file to the newly created "**.ebextensions**" directory. Extract the contents with your favorite archive extractor (make sure files are extracted to "**.ebextensions/**" and not "**.ebextensions/eb/**").

### Create an AWS Account

1. Navigate to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then click **Create an AWS Account**.
2. Follow along with the signup wizard.

### Add yourself as an administrative user

1. Now that you are logged into the AWS Management Console, click **Services** and then click **IAM**.
2. In the left pane, click **Dashboard**, and copy down the IAM user sign-in link.
3. In the left pane, click **Users**.
4. Click **Add user**.
5. Under **Set user details**, enter your username in the **User name** field.
6. Under **Select AWS access type**, select only **AWS Management Console access** in the **Access type** area.
7. Click **Next: Permissions**.
8. Under **Set permissions for ...**, click the **Attach existing policies directly**  box.
9. With the table at the bottom of the page in view, select **AdministratorAccess** (will be the first row).
10. Click **Next: Review**.
11. Under **Review**, ensure all information reflects the above steps.
12. Click **Next: Create user**.
13. Log out of the AWS console, go to the sign-in link you copied down in step 2, and log in with your new credentials.
14. (_Optional but highly recommended step_): Enable two-factor authentication via the **Security credentials** tab of your user profile in IAM. Click the pencil beside **Assigned MFA Device** to start this process.
