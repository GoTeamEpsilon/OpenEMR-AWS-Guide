### What does the architecture look like?

![diagram](../Assets/diagrams/architecture.png)

### How do I deploy custom changes to my cloud?

The most robust and maintainable approach for deployments is to keep an internal changelog of your changes along with associated [version control tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). Not only will this help you stay organized, but you can also reference it in the case you wish to rollback to a previous deployment and aid in reapplying your custom changes when a newer version of OpenEMR is available.

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and then choose **openemr/your_practice**.
2. Click the **Upload and Deploy** button in the center of the screen.
3. Click **Choose File** and select "**openemr.zip**". Note that the name of this file must be exact.
4. Under **Label**, enter in **"openemr-deployment-N"** where **N** is most recent version of your deployment.
5. Click **Deploy**.

### How do I access system logs?

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and then choose **openemr/your_practice**.
2. In the left hand pane, click **Logs**.
3. Click the **Request Logs** button to the to pright of the screen.
4. Click **Full Logs** and wait a moment for the logs to download.
5. Extract the contents with your favorite archive extractor to view each instance's Apache logs in **logs_directory/var/log/httpd**.

### How do I restore a database backup?

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **RDS**.
2. In the left hand pane, click **Instances**.
3. Checkbox your database instance.
4. Click the **Instance Actions** button in the center of the screen.
5. Click **Restore to Point in Time**.
6. Enter the date and time for your restore under **Use Custom Restore Time**.
7. Configure the database restore instance as you did when [creating the initial system](#-database-system).
8. SSH into any EC2 instance associated with the Elastic Beanstalk environment and note the values in **openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php**.
9. Update your local **openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php** with these noted values, but with the new MySQL restore endpoint information.
10. Reploy the application via [the instructions in the deployment section](#how-do-i-deploy-custom-changes-to-my-cloud).

### How do I Access the Database?

_TODO: Shouldn't this be using the pem file for added security?_

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **RDS**.
2. In the left hand pane, click **Instances**.
3. Checkbox your database instance.
4. Note the database **Endpoint** including the port number.
5. Click the **Instance Actions** button in the center of the screen.
6. Click **Modify**.
7. Under **Network & Security**, select **"Yes"** for **Publicly Accessible**.
8. Click **Continue** and then **Modify DB Instance**.
9. Perform your MySQL work by running `mysql -u (stored database username) -p (stored database password) -h (noted endpoint:port) openemr` on your local computer. If you aren't sure, [download and install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and [familiarize yourself with interacting with data](https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+mysql).
10. Back in the AWS Management Console, reset **Publicly Accessible** to **"No"**, using the previous steps as a guide.

### How do I SSH Into Instances?

Accessing your instances with SSH is one of the more challenging tasks in this guide. As such, be sure to treat this as a learning opportunity and pay close attention to the instructions to ensure the most seamless experience.

#### Prerequisites

1. Download and install the latest [PuTTY MSI](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) software suite. If you aren't sure, click [here](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.69-installer.msi).
2. Using your AWS SSH keypair that is saved as **"your-username.pem"**, convert it to a **ppk** file by following [these instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html#putty-private-key).

#### Redis Access

_TODO: The security group should have a name and not use default launch wizard_

_TODO: Test SSH out with the "my ip address" as source_

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **EC2** and then click **Running Instances**.
2. Select the "**openemr-redis**" instance.
3. Under **Elastic IPs**, note the address.
4. Under **Security groups** in the bottom pane, click the group starting with "**launch-wizard-"**.
5. Click the **Actions** dropdown.
6. Click **Edit inbound rules**.
7. Click **Add Rule**.
8. Under **Type**, select "**SSH**".
9. Under **Source**, select "**Anywhere**".
10. Click **Save**.
11. Using your **"your-username.ppk"** keypair, access your instance by following [these instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html#putty-ssh). Note that step 1 can be skipped and that **"user_name@public_dns_name"** is **"ubuntu@(your previously noted elastic ip)"**.
12. Perform your SSH work.
13. Back in the AWS Management Console, remove the **SSH** inbound rule, using the previous steps as a guide.

#### Elastic Beanstalk Instance Access

_TODO: The security group should have a name and not use default generated group_

_TODO: The security group already have the SSH revoked... currently it is there by default_

_TODO: Test SSH out with the "my ip address" as source_

1. In the AWS Management Console, click **Services**, **EC2**, and then **Running Instances**.
2. Select the **openemr** instance you are interested in accessing.
3. Under **Public DNS (IPv4)**, note the address.
4. Under **Security groups** in the bottom pane, click the first group.
5. Click the **Actions** dropdown.
6. Click **Edit inbound rules**.
7. Click **Add Rule**.
8. Under **Type**, select "**SSH**".
9. Under **Source**, select "**Anywhere**".
10. Click **Save**.
11. Using your **"your-username.ppk"** keypair, access your instance by following [these instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html#putty-ssh). Note that step 1 can be skipped and that **"user_name@public_dns_name"** is **"ec2-user@(your previously noted public dns ip)"**.
12. Perform your SSH work.
13. Back in the AWS Management Console, remove the **SSH** inbound rule, using the previous steps as a guide.

### What are the Recommendations for Development and Testing?

If you aren't planning on customizing OpenEMR source code, you can simply use one AWS environment. Otherwise, it is best to break out the environments as follows:

- **local** - A local installation of OpenEMR for developers to code against. Refer to the [wiki](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Downloads) to see how to set it up on Debian-based Linux and Windows.

- **dev** - A small resources AWS environment for developers to try out their local code changes on. Although developers will have a local OpenEMR installation to work with, it is best to have an environment for testing these changes on an actual cloud environment.

- **test** - A small resources AWS environment for testers to ensure new code changes work. This is different from dev in that it testers may use a special dataset to test code changes more realistically and, unlike dev, it is dedicated to testers so that the developers can make changes to their environment without impacting the testing efforts.

- **stage** - This is an AWS environment identical to production for final testing efforts. Unlike dev and test, stage may contain a mirror of actual production data to achieve the most realistic verification before applying code changes to production.

- **production** - This is the live AWS environment in which users are using. Code changes should only be applied to production after going through dev, test, and stage.

### What are the Recommendations for Tracking Custom Code Changes?

As noted in the first section of this guide, the user is required to hold a local copy of OpenEMR. This is the actual source code that will run in the AWS environment. If you are planning on making a lot of code customizations, it is best to use [Git with a centralized cloud setup](https://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/). This approach makes certain that no changes are lost and multiple team members can access the code.

Regardless of if you planning on making a lot or a few changes to the OpenEMR source code, it is recommended to keep a running document of how to re-apply said changes when upgrading your OpenEMR codebase. This is best done in the Git repository via a markdown file should you choose that route. Otherwise, consider something like a [cloud file storage solution](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dropbox-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive-cloud-storage-best/) to centrally and safely store the document.
