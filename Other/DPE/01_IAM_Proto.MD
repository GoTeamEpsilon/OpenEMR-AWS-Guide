- sign up for AWS
- download google authenticator…a virtual MFA device
- set up MFA 
- Delete the Root access keys
- strict password policy with rotation, prevent reuse, special symbols, etc
- create IAM user with administratoraccess…use this account instead
- any other users??

* (do you need to create groups with all the policies attached to them you might use and then later just put users in those groups?)
